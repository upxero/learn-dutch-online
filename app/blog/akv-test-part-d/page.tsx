              The duration of this test is 2 hours and contains around 40 multiple choice questions about the Dutch healthcare laws. As we at Learn Dutch Online, are tailored to teaching language and not legal matter, we assist students with unraveling the meaning of the phrases and laws so that context can be discerned to some students whom are stuck.
            </p>
            <p>
              Often the context is lost due to the meaning of words or phrases being lost in translation, leading to inaccurate conclusions which can give detrimental results in technical legal concepts.
